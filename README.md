# Ara3D.Revit.Utils

A library of helpful, efficient, and well designed, utility functions and classes for accelerating the development of high-quality Revit plug-ins.  

## Motivation

There is a lot of helpful code online for working with Revit, unfortunately some of it has gotten quite old, and some of it was written using software engineering best practices.

Additionally Revit plug-in developers tend to cut and paste, or re-invent, the same unwieldy and sub-par code over and over again. 

We have decided to share our utility libraries to enable us, and others to develop better quality extensions to Revit, in less time.

By making it open-source we hope that others not only may find it useful, but that they can easily identify areas for improvement and contribute back to it.
